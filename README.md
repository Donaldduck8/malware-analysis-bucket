A Scoop bucket for applications that I frequently use during malware analysis. This bucket complements the ``extras`` bucket.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add malware-analysis-bucket https://github.com/Donaldduck8/malware-analysis-bucket
scoop install malware-analysis-bucket/<manifestname>
```

## How do I contribute new manifests?

and [App Manifests](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifests)
